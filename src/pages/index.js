            We all know that Dell Notebooks are one of the most popular Dell
            products. We have decided to reduce the burden on Energy and
            Environment caused by the conventional notebook packaging.

        <h1>Problem</h1>
          <p>
            After buying a notebook, people either store their notebook package
            long enough and then throw it away or they throw it away as soon as
            they get it. This cause a huge burden on the environment, giving
            rise to waste and energy management problems.
            <br />
            The current Dell Notebook packages are curbside recyclable; however,
            people do not take the initiative to recycle it because of a
            plethora of reasons including, but not limited to: lack of
            incentives, comfort, and space. This, in turn, leads to unnecessary
            dumping of non-biodegradable materials in the landfill sites, hence
            nullifying the whole purpose of making it recyclable.
            <br />
            The e-commerce platforms are flourishing with sales more than ever
            before but with e-commerce comes the problem of returns and repairs
            as well which are logistical nightmares for them.
            <br />
            Despite all precautions the fact of the matter is electronics are
            fragile products which have a significant chance of getting damaged
            during transits.

        <h1>Solution</h1>
          <p>
            People who use notebooks often feel the need to buy various
            accessories to make their working life more comfortable and
            productive. This has been heightened by the current situation in the
            world when all sorts of accessories are being bought by employees
            working from home to increase their efficiency. Not only
            accessories, most businesses, schools, and public services are
            buying more and more laptops to follow proper social distancing and
            work from home protocols.

            Reusing is better than recycling because it saves the energy that
            comes with having to dismantle and re-manufacture products. It also
            significantly reduces waste and the subsequent pollution caused by
            it because it lessens the need for raw materials, saving both
            forests and water supplies. Therefore, through our product, we would
            like to focus on reusability but still keeping in mind recyclability
            as all products outlive there utilities.
