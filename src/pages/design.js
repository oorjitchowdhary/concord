            Our main vision for the product is sustainability. Reusing is better
            than recycling because it saves the energy that comes with having to
            dismantle and re-manufacture products. Through our product, we focus
            on reusability while keeping in mind recyclability as all products
            outlive their utilities. Our package design allows the consumers to
            use it as a Notebook Stand and a Notebook Holder â€” something that
            consumers often shell out extra cash for. Thus, people won't have to
            throw their package away instantly.
